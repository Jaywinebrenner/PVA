# Police Violence Archive F.A.Q.

## What is The Police Violence Archive?

The Police Violence Archive project is inspired by a Google spreadsheet that tracked police brutality incidents that were filmed and shared on Twitter.  This spreadsheet went viral because an archive of this kind does not exist.  The purpose of this project is to create an archive of these incidents so that they are easily and readily available to the people who matter.  People like:

- Policy Makers
- Police Reform Activists
- Community Members
- Politicians
- Media Creators
- Police Officers
- Everyday Citizens
- Pro and Anti Police Reform Folks
- Everyone

## What is the project objective?

This project aims to create an archive of police violence event videos that are tracked, categorized, searchable, and easy to access.  This archive will be a powerful tool in helping those fighting to make a change by holding police officers and police organizations accountable.  It will also be useful in showing everyday folks the regular violence that happens in their cities.

## What is the inspiration for the project?

In May 2020, during the national Black Lives Matter and anti-police violence protests, a spreadsheet which tracked police violence recorded events had gone viral.  It was mentioned in several media outlets:

- [Slate - Activists Create Public Online Spreadsheet of Police Violence Videos](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kpbmy/police-violence-at-protests-is-undeniable-all-the-videos-are-right-here)

- [Vice - Police Violence at Protests Is Undeniable. All the Videos Are Right Here](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/george-floyd-public-spreadsheet-police-violence-videos.html)


This project is meant to incoporate their data into a web app to ease access for everyone.

## Hasnâ€™t this already been done?

There are a few similar projects that already exist:

- https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/
- https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality
- https://maminian.github.io/brutality-map/
- https://policeabuses.info/#/
- https://filepolicereport.com/

None of the above listed projects specifically track police violence videos in an easy to search and categorize format that also has high a high SEO ranking.  In order for a tool to be utilized by the people, they need to know that it exists and it needs to be easy to use.  The purpose of this project is to fulfil both of those objectives.

## What are the long-term goals?

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an open-source project in which people find value and is used as a tool for change and accountability.  Once a general MVP is created, project leaders will reach out to local and/or national non-profits to provide ongoing support and maintenance of the project.
